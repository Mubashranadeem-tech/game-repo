This the Mafia Game based on the Html and cpp.
Goal: 

Build a crime empire by controlling 10 territories or eliminating rival gang members (<3).

Resources: Manage money ($500K start), gang members (25), loyalty (90%), and police suspicion (40%).

Attacks: Fight rivalsâ€”win to gain territories/money or lose members/suspicion.

Bribes: Pay police to reduce suspicion (higher suspicion = bigger bribes needed).

Recruitment: Spend $50K/member to grow your gang (lowers loyalty slightly).

Police Raid: Game over if suspicion hits 100%.

Loyalty: Below 20% = members defect to rivals.

Bankruptcy: Money < $10K = instant loss.

Opponent: Random power (50-100) determines their aggression/territories.

Win Fast: Balance strength, loyalty, and police relations to dominate.

Core: Risk vs. reward in every action!
